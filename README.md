### `Application Features`

1. Users should be able to answer questions related to the environment
1. Users should be able to filter categories based on difficulty (grade-level) or category
1. Application should be beautiful and easily navigated

### `Known Issues`

1. It doesn't work. Seriously. Don't expect anything.
1. I don't know where the issue happened, maybe running commands for the pwa. Could've been fixing errors that needed fixed to get the app into production mode.
1. I was making great progress, just ran out of time. I've been distracted with job-hunting and working on other things. The front end was so beautiful too, darn shame.

## What I actually did have...

1. An application that got data from firebase
  1. Checked to see if the user was logged in
  1. Logged in anonamously if not
  1. Sort of dealt with the data received (was interrupted with a 7AM deadline)
    * All of this was done in a service file
1. Incorrectly displayed data on the screen (Could be why it isn't working, but shouldn't be)
    * Done in the html file and ts file attached to it
1. Well themed application with a decent UI
1. Multiple pages that could be navigated between
  1. Home
  1. Category Filter
  1. Grade Filter
    * Done using ionic-side-menu starter template (this complicated things)
